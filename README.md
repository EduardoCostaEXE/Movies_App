# Movies_App

## Overview

Movies App is an iOS application developed for study purposes. It aims to simulate a streaming service like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max, and Apple TV+. Users can browse movies by genres, see popular movies, and favorite the ones they like. This project helped me reinforce some knowledge I had previously used and learn new techniques, such as using gradients.

## Features

Browse Movies by Genre: Explore movies categorized by genres.
Popular Movies: View a list of popular movies.
Favorite Movies: Mark and unmark movies as favorites.
Gradients: Applied gradient layers for enhanced UI.

## Technologies Used

Swift: Core programming language used for app development.
UIKit: Framework used to construct and manage the app's user interface.
TheMoviesDB API: Used to fetch movie data.
UserDefaults: For storing user preferences like favorite movies.
CAGradientLayer: Used to implement gradient layers.

## Inspiration

The idea for this app was inspired by challenges proposed by companies such as Globo, BTG Pactual, and CI&T a few years ago. For personal reasons, the app was built without using external libraries, focusing on a pure implementation with Swift.

## Future Plans

Feature Enhancements: The app is still in its initial version, and I plan to add new features as soon as possible.
Flutter Version: I intend to replicate this app in Flutter for further study.
